# OpenCore VMDK Images 🖥️

OpenCore VMDK files for tahoe (AMD-Intel), available in releases.

AMD ones are only tested on Ryzen cpus

For AMD cpus grab one with cores specifed for example 1.0.5-(8-cores) download and mount in VMware. Make sure the core count is set as 8 (for 8 cores) in the VM settings.

For Intel cpus grab one with Intel endfix you dont need to apply patches for any core count.

Intel ones are not tested i applied what worked for AMD cpus
